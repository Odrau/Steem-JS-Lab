# Steem-JS-Lab
I'm posting some of the little tools I come up with using SteemJs.

>I'm learning Javascript while intereacting with SteemJs, Bootstrap, Jquerry, and other libraries. I like thinking outside the box and coming up with solutions that will help the average person.  If you have any suggestions or ideas, please join my Discord server and let me know!
